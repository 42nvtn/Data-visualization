This repository contains all the related works for my Data Visualization course:
# Covid-19 data visualiztion
We crawl Covid-19 data from [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) on a daily basis. Initially, we merge all the daily files into a single file, followed by preprocessing the data and creating visualizations using Python (in an ipynb file) and Tableau (in a pdf file) to extract valuable insights.

**My part: Global visualization**
# Life Expectency
We obtain data from [Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who). Next, we use Tableau to create visualizations and conduct a comprehensive analysis of the data to extract valuable insights.
